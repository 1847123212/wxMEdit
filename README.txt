About:
-----
wxMEdit is a cross-platform Text/Hex Editor written in C++ & wxWidgets.
wxMEdit a fork of MadEdit which has been discontinued.
wxMEdit supports many useful functions, e.g. SyntaxHighlightings, WordWraps, 
Encodings, Column/Hex Modes, and a Plugin system(not work yet).
In HexMode, wxMEdit can open large files which size is up to 32GB (INT_MAX*16).


Supported Platforms:
-------------------
A. Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and other Unix-like OS (__WXGTK__):
   a. GNU C++ 3.x/4.x:
      Required Libraries to compile:
      1. wxWidgets-2.6.1 or higher with Unicode enabled

      5. automake 1.9 or higher

B. MS Windows (__WXMSW__):
   a. MinGW32/GNU C++ 3.x/4.x:
      Required Libraries to compile:
      1. wxWidgets-2.6.1 or higher with Unicode enabled
      2. Boost-1.33.0 or higher
      3. libunicows: it's optional under WinNT/XP, but required under Win98
      4. ICU4C 4.2 or higher
      5. Bakefile 0.2.9
   b. Visual C++ 2003/2005/2008/2010(by upgrading from 2008 solution and project files):
      Required Libraries to compile:
      1. wxWidgets-2.6.1 or higher with Unicode enabled
      2. Boost-1.33.0 or higher
      3. libunicows: it's optional under WinNT/XP, but required under Win98
      4. ICU4C 4.2 or higher
      5. Bakefile 0.2.9

NOTE:
   You can download Bakefile at:
      http://www.bakefile.org/download.html

   If you use Boost-1.33, you should get Boost.Xpressive and Boost.Foreach at:
      http://code.google.com/p/wxmedit/
      http://wxmedit.googlecode.com/files/xpressive_foreach.tgz
      http://wxmedit.googlecode.com/files/xpressive_foreach.zip

   If you use wxWidgets-2.6, you should get wxAUI:
      http://wxmedit.googlecode.com/files/wxAUI.tgz
      http://wxmedit.googlecode.com/files/wxAUI.zip

   The small tool image2xpm was removed. 
   You can turn to GIMP, XnView, IrfanView, etc. or get image2xpm at:
      http://wxmedit.googlecode.com/files/image2xpm.exe
      http://wxmedit.googlecode.com/files/image2xpm_src.zip

Syntax files, Locale files and Settings:
---------------------------------------
  Syntax files: in the path $(wxMEditConfigPath)/syntax/
  Locale files: in the path $(wxMEditConfigPath)/locale/
  
  $(wxMEditConfigPath) are the one of below paths:
    1. wxMEdit execution file directory : Windows and Linux
    2. $(HOME)/.wxmedit/ : Linux
    3. /usr/share/wxmedit/ : Linux
  
  If wxMEdit does not find any files in those paths, 
  wxMEdit can also execute standalone by using default settings.
  
  If you are under Win98, you must get unicows.dll from MS's website:
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=73BA7BD7-ED06-4F0D-80A4-2A7EEAEE17E2&displaylang=en
  
  When quit wxMEdit, wxMEdit will save the settings to:
    1. $(HOME)/.wxmedit/wxmedit.cfg: Linux
    2. $(wxMEdit execution file directory)/wxmedit.cfg: Windows
  And FontWidth.dat will also be saved to the same path.
  FontWidth.dat is Cache of Font-Width-Data, it can speed-up wxMEdit a lot.
